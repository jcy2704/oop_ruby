# About TIC TAC TOE And Instructions
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

# Game Rules:

Two player game
First player plays with the 'O' symbol
Second player plays with the 'X' symbol
Players take turns choosing a cell of the board to mark their symbol.
A player can only choose an empty cell.
The first player to complete a succession of 3 of their assigned symbol (O's or X's) in a row, column or diagonal wins!
If all of the cells are filled with a symbol and no player matched 3 symbols, the game ends in a tie.

# About The Project
In here you will find a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

The game has a basic interface that runs in the terminal.

The goals of this project are:

-Practice with OOP (Object Oriented Programming) using Ruby as the language of choice.
-Learn how to structure a Ruby project.
-Correct use of logic and interface files to keep code maintainable.
-Practice of Git Flow and Github Flow creating branches for the different features.
-This is also part of the Odin project curriculum https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop
